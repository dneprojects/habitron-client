# Changelog

## 1.0.0

First fully asynchronous, strictly typed release. **Breaking**: the synchronous
API was removed without replacement (path A); consumers must migrate to the
async client.

### Changed
- `HabitronClient` is now async-only and used as `async with HabitronClient(...)`.
  All bus methods are coroutines backed by `asyncio` `StreamReader`/`StreamWriter`
  (true non-blocking I/O, no executor threads).
- A single persistent connection per client, serialised by a lock, with a
  central reconnect-once strategy on connection loss.
- Command templates are typed `Command` values; arguments are `int | bytes`.
- YAML responses are parsed with `yaml.safe_load` and validated against
  `TypedDict` models.
- `send_network_info` separates the pure `_scramble_token` logic from I/O.
- Network discovery and DNS resolution are now async.

### Added
- Typed exception hierarchy: `HabitronError` → `HabitronConnectionError`,
  `HabitronTimeoutError`, `HabitronProtocolError` (→ `HabitronChecksumError`,
  `HabitronBusError`).
- `py.typed` marker — the package is now PEP 561 compliant.
- Async bus-simulator test suite (96% coverage) and a CI workflow running
  `ruff`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict` and `pytest --cov`.

### Removed
- The synchronous `*_sync` methods, the `b""`/`b"OK"` sentinel returns and the
  `SMHUB_COMMANDS` string table.

### Notes
- The short-acknowledgement handling (a sub-header response is treated as the
  hub closing the connection) is inferred from the legacy code and should be
  confirmed against recorded bus captures. See `_transport.py`.
